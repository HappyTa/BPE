# Byte Pair Encoding Learning Project

This repo was made to store my implementation of *Byte Pair Encoding* (BPE).

**Byte Pair Encoding**: A corpus based tokenizer that focus on the *Morphemes* of the word.

Properties of BPE:

- Uses the training data to define how to tokenize.
- Tend to only pick frequent words, and frequent subwords (i.e. Morphemes).

## TODO

- [ ] Implement BPE
  - [ ] Input through std
